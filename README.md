## Installation

Step by step instructions:

1. `cd` into the project root folder.

2. At the unix command prompt, type the following to make `kw-easy-data.py` executable:

`$ chmod +x kw-easy-data.py`

3. Move `kw-easy-data.py` into your preferred bin directory, or even better, create a symlink to it with `ln -s $PWD/kw-easy-data.py /usr/local/bin/kw-easy-data`. Obviously make sure you change your paths according to your OS and file structure. Now the script will be runnable from anywhere with the command `kw-easy-data`.

4. Make sure you install all the dependencies with `pip3 install [dependency_name]` before running the script.
