## How it works

work in progress...

## Installation

By installing I mean making sure we can run this script from everywhere in the terminal.

1. At the unix command prompt, type the following to make `kw-easy-data.py` executable:

`$ chmod +x kw-easy-data.py`

2. Move `kw-easy-data.py` into your bin directory.

That's it now the script will be runnable from anywhere.
